# Design Pattern

This repository contains various design patterns implemented in individual scenarios, along with a final project, Racing In IUT. I have given the list of the implemented design patterns and a brief description of the final project.
### Builder Pattern
### Composite Pattern
### Memento Pattern
### Strategy Pattern
### Singleton Pattern
### Template Pattern


## Final Project: Racing In IUT
**Racing In IUT** is a simplified single-player racing game using several design patterns. The player can choose a car, select a track, and race against time with the option to make pit stops for a Nitrous Oxide System (NOS) boost. The following design patterns are used in this project:
1. **Strategy Pattern**: For car behavior such as engine and turbocharger strategies.
2. **Template Pattern**: For defining the generalized steps of the race.
3. **Singleton Pattern**: To ensure only one instance of the Player class exists.
4. **Factory Pattern**: For creating cars and tracks.
5. **Decorator Pattern**: To add NOS functionality to cars at runtime.
